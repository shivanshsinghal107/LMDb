Among Dr. Sagan's favorite topics are the origins of life, the search for life on Mars, the infernal composition of the atmosphere of Venus and a warning about a similar effect taking place on Earth due to global pollution and the ""greenhouse effect"", the lives of stars, interstellar travel and the effects of attaining the speed of light, the danger of mankind technologically self-destructing, and the search, using radio technology, for intelligent life in deep space.","Carl Sagan(Self - Host), Jaromír Hanzlík(Johannes Kepler), Jonathan Fahn(Young Champollion / ...), Alan Belod(Jean-Francois Champollion), Jean Charney(Betty Hill)"
